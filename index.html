              Malaysia continues to attract millions of international visitors
              each year, with neighbouring countries like Singapore, Indonesia,
              and Thailand leading the arrivals. In 2024, arrivals from
              Singapore surpassed 18 million, reflecting strong cross-border
              tourism ties and Malaysia's role as a regional hub. While
              short-haul travellers dominate, long-haul visitors from China,
              India, and the United Kingdom have also grown sharply, supported
              by new flight routes and visa-friendly policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Domestic tourism remains robust, with Malaysians significantly
              contributing to hotel stays across states from Kuala Lumpur to
              Sabah. As the country expands its cultural and eco-tourism
              offerings, industry analysts predict sustained growth in both
              arrivals and hotel occupancy rates, highlighting Malaysia's
              resilient and evolving tourism landscape.

              the previous year. Mid-year months from May to August see
              particularly strong gains, and December records the highest
              arrivals at over 3.8 million, reflecting peak travel season driven

            The line chart tracks the relationship between the U.S. dollar to
            Malaysian ringgit (USD/MYR) exchange rate and monthly foreign
            tourist arrivals from January 2023 through December 2024. The
            ringgit steadily weakened through much of 2023, with the exchange
            rate hovering around 4.5 to 4.8 per dollar, while tourist arrivals
            fluctuated more sharply, rising above 3 million in mid-2023 before
            dipping at the start of 2024.
          </p>
          <p>
            By mid-2024, arrivals surged, peaking around 4.5 million in August,
            even as the currency remained under pressure. The data suggests that
            visitor inflows were resilient despite currency volatility, possibly
            even benefitting from a weaker ringgit that made Malaysia more
            attractive to foreign travelers. The steady climb in arrivals
            through 2024, despite a persistently weak ringgit, demonstrates
            Malaysia's growing appeal as a destination and the resilience of its
            tourism sector.
